# EuroCB-green-speech

This R code relates to the creation of an app on Shiny for a better visual representation of the database I constructed on speeches pronounced by representatives of Central Banks, members of the Eurosystem, on the subject of which policies should be prioritized in relation to climate change and its risks, as well as their motivations.

The resulting Shiny app enhances the experience of exploratory data analysis intended in my original article where I conducted said research. It allows for the plotting of the diferent policy type and motivation variables as a bar plot, stacked bar plot, mosaic plot, heatmap, and segmented bar plot.
